## Simple CRUD API using Laravel

- Currently uses firebase to store date using <a href="https://github.com/kreait/laravel-firebase">https://github.com/kreait/laravel-firebase</a>.
- Mock employee data storing service

<p> Tested CRUD methods by using the desktop Postman application pointing to localhost </p>

- GET /employees to list all
- POST /employees to create new employee
- GET /employees/{id} to get single employee
- PUT /employees/{id} to update single employee
- DELETE /employees/{id} to delete single employee
